  Interactive Lab: Deploying FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall in Microsoft Azure
</div>

In this lab, I deployed a FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall within the Microsoft Azure cloud environment to create a realistic network scenario. The lab involved setting up various cloud resources, including servers that were publicly accessible, to simulate a dynamic cybersecurity landscape.

To explore the effectiveness of the FortiGate firewall, I generated a series of cybersecurity threats, including brute force attacks and network scanning against a public-facing virtual machine. This allowed me to observe how the next-gen firewall detects and responds to potential cyber threats in real time.

Additionally, I configured the environment to send all activity logs from the firewall to Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) solution. This integration enabled me to create custom alerts and conduct real-time incident response, such as blocking malicious IP addresses, analyzing alerts, and taking proactive steps to mitigate threats.

Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience in managing a cloud-based security infrastructure, configuring a next-gen firewall, and enhancing my skills in incident detection and response using Microsoft Sentinel.
